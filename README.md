# Eat-Da-Burger!
Eat-Da-Burger! is a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. The app follows the MVC design pattern, uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and uses Handlebars to generate the HTML.

Submit a burger using the form and it will store to the database and display on the left side of the page. Click "devour it" and the burger will be updated in the database as devoured and will be moved to the right side of the page.
